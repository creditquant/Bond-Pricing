Unlike the Equity Market, the Bond Market suffers from a severe lack of information.  With no quotes publicly available, the best way to get a quote is to solicit multiple brokers and wait for a reply.  Benchmark Solutions plans to predict accurate prices that incorporate interest rate data, trades or quotes of the bond in question, trades or quotes of other bonds or CDS of the issuer of the bond in question as well as other input sources.
